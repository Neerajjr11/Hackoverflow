## Getting Started

## Problem Statement
* Colleges in India don't have a central database regarding campus placement in technical and business institutes and universities.
* By mapping and collating the placement details from throughout the county, the percentage of unemployability, the average salary and benefits, and other details can be identified in various fields of education.
* Help the policy makers to come out with appropriate solutions through framing of policies, based on data from this database, for tackling the unemployability in the country.

## About the Problem
* Unemployment in India is rising at an alarming rate in India, despite several technical and business institutes booming across the country.
Though education level in recent years has improved, skill development is still a crucial issue. India has the largest population of youth in the world. Around 65 per cent of the population of India is under the age of 35, so the impact of the declining financial market and the lack of job opportunities has the worst effect in India.
Moreover there is no centralised database regarding campus placement in technical and business institutes, universities for policy makers to analyse and come out with appropriate solutions.

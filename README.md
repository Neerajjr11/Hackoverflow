## Getting Started

## Problem Statement
* Colleges in India don't have a central database regarding campus placement in technical and business institutes and universities.
* By mapping and collating the placement details from throughout the county, the percentage of unemployability, the average salary and benefits, and other details can be identified in various fields of education.
* Help the policy makers to come out with appropriate solutions through framing of policies, based on data from this database, for tackling the unemployability in the country.
